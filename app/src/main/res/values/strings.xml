<P class="p54 ft17">By using this website, such persons expressly consent to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies only to the SWARNKAR website. Websites or online services provided by third parties accessible by a link on the SWARNKAR website and users of this website who enter into any online communication or transaction with each other, such as a job seeker and employer, may have their own distinct privacy policy. Users assume responsibility for informing themselves of the privacy policies of such third parties and other users and making any user choices, including refraining from communicating with such third parties or other users whose privacy policy they do not accept.</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">SWARNKAR reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time.

<P class="p6 ft11">Information collection</P>
<P class="p55 ft10">SWARNKAR collects information from and regarding individuals in a variety of ways from a variety of sources. SWARNKAR initially collects information from users of its website during their visits to the website. We may also collect information externally from this website, such as information regarding those job seekers who secure employment with or through SWARNKAR and those employers who are or become clients of SWARNKAR. This information enables us to profile the interests of employers and job seekers, post and solicit applications for job openings and orders and track the status of pending openings.</P>
<P class="p56 ft10">We sometimes afford job seekers and employers an opportunity to provide us with specific additional information when they enroll on this website and complete their profile, such as their physical geographical location. Providing this information is optional. However, providing this information helps us better serve job seekers, employers and other website visitors by including their preferences and choices on various options.</P>
<P class="p57 ft10">SWARNKAR also collects and uses information by installing small computer files (known as cookies) on the hard drive of each computer used to visit our website. A cookie is a string of information sent by a website and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer\'s memory. Cookies are an important element of your experience on our website. They allow us to welcome you each time you visit and customize our information to your past website experiences. Cookies also help us detect and stop fraud.</P>
<P class="p58 ft18">The website may include <NOBR>first-party</NOBR> cookies (i.e., cookies that send data directly to SWARNKAR and agents and contractors acting on behalf of SWARNKAR , used to monitor, analyze and administer the website) and <NOBR>third-party</NOBR> cookies (i.e., cookies that send data to our contractors for their commercial use). The cookies on our website may also track Internet activities across different websites.</P>
<P class="p59 ft18">Some computer browsers permit you to disable or uninstall cookies, and you may do so by following the instructions provided by your hardware and software vendors.

Your computer\'s IP address is not necessarily linked to your personally identifiable information, but does distinguish your computer from other computers that access the SWARNKAR website. SWARNKAR may use traffic data and your computer\'s IP address to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends, administer its website, and serve more relevant advertising via Google\'s advertising network and for other purposes. SWARNKAR may also use your computer\'s IP address to identify you as a distinct, though anonymous, visitor, for whom the experience may be personalized during future visits.</P>

<P class="p46 ft11">Tracking</P>
<P class="p62 ft10">Some Web browsers may be configured to send Do Not Track signals to websites, or users may use similar mechanisms to indicate a user’s preference that certain web technologies not be used to track the user’s online activity. The website does not accept or process such Do Not Track signals or similar mechanisms.</P>
<P class="p63 ft11">Information use</P>
<P class="p55 ft10">SWARNKAR uses each registered job seeker\'s personal information to administer the various services opted for by the job seeker and to make the job seeker aware of career opportunities and other developments from time to time. Personal data is information which can be used to identify you, such as name, date of birth, identification number or other factors specific to your identity, such as address, telephone, email or cell/mobile number.</P>
<P class="p64 ft20">The user information that SWARNKAR collects may be added to our databases and used for business purposes, including for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of users’ behaviour, for product development, for content improvement, or to customize the content and layout of the website. In addition, SWARNKAR will, on occasion, send emails to you about job information you requested from the website or <NOBR>third-party</NOBR> products. If you do not want to receive email from us, visit the “Opt Out” or “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any SWARNKAR email to remove yourself from continued receipt of such email messages.</P>
<P class="p65 ft10">Among other uses, SWARNKAR uses the information to identify an individual as a registered job seeker, to present potential employment opportunities to the job seeker, to present the job seeker to potential employers and to report these transactions to the relevant job seeker. We also give each job seeker the option to receive certain targeted communications from time to time.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_12">


<P class="p20 ft11">Information sharing</P>
<P class="p55 ft10">With the job seeker\'s permission, SWARNKAR may submit the job seeker\'s resume, application and/or other information to a prospective employer on the basis that such prospective employer will not disclose the fact that such job seeker is seeking employment or communicate with any other person regarding the contents of such job seeker\'s resume or application except with the job seeker\'s consent or otherwise in compliance with applicable labor and employment laws.</P>
<P class="p66 ft10">SWARNKAR may also from time to time submit the job seeker\'s profile, with sufficient information removed so that the job seeker is not readily personally identifiable, to prospective employers to solicit their potential interest in him or her as a job candidate.</P>
<P class="p67 ft17">SWARNKAR may share a job seeker\'s personal information with entities with whom it contracts to assist in administering the website, including the job board on the website, from time to time.

For the purposes mentioned above, SWARNKAR may transfer your personal data to other SWARNKAR entities that provide services on behalf of SWARNKAR .</P>
<P class="p69 ft10">We may also share your information with any successor or assign some or all of the relevant part of our business, whether through a sale of our business, merger or otherwise.</P>
<P class="p70 ft10">We may share user information with appropriate third parties when we believe, in our sole discretion, that such sharing is appropriate: to comply with the law, including but not limited to, in response to a subpoena served on SWARNKAR ; to enforce or apply this Privacy Policy or other applicable terms, rules or policies; to protect the rights, property or safety of SWARNKAR , our users or others; or to prevent activity that we believe, in our sole discretion, may be or may become illegal, unethical or legally actionable (including exchanging user information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection).</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_13">


<P class="p29 ft10">In all cases in which we share a job seeker\'s personal information, we will seek contractual commitments from the party with whom we share such information to abide by the same terms and conditions as those applicable to us in this Privacy Policy regarding the use, sharing, retention, care and disposal of such information.</P>
<P class="p71 ft20">Please note that if you use any bulletin board, chat room, comment posting feature or other public communication service, forum or feature offered through the website, or post any information available for viewing by other users, any of the information that you share will be visible to other users.

<P class="p72 ft11">Information security incident response</P>
<P class="p62 ft10">If an unforeseen event occurs that results in the discovery that your personal information has been involved in a <NOBR>cyber-security</NOBR> or data breach incident, we will take appropriate steps to respond to the incident, in a timely manner and, if applicable, notify you of the incident so you can take whatever steps may be necessary to protect your personal information.</P>
<P class="p63 ft11">Retention of personal information</P>
<P class="p55 ft10">SWARNKAR will keep your personal information for as long as we have a business need and purpose to retain the information, including storage for auditing and archival purposes.

<P class="p45 ft11">Accessing and updating your profile</P>
<P class="p37 ft10">Job seekers may review, update or remove their job seeker profile directly from the website from time to time (subject to SWARNKAR’s storage policies, as described above).
